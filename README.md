# 🕵️‍♂️ Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis

This project demonstrates how to capture and analyze network traffic using **Wireshark**. The goal was to identify basic protocols and understand how data flows through the network.

---

## 📁 Contents

- `my-capture.pcap` — The raw packet capture file.
- `Wireshark_Report.md` — A short report summarizing key findings and protocols identified.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Capture live network packets using Wireshark.
- Filter traffic by protocols like HTTP, DNS, and TCP.
- Identify and describe at least 3 protocols.
- Export findings and document the process.

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Wireshark** — Open-source packet analyzer
- Basic command-line tools (`ping`, web browser)

## 🔍 Summary of Protocols Observed

| Protocol | Description                     |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| DNS      | Used for domain name resolution |
| TCP      | Ensures reliable data delivery  |
| HTTP     | Used for website data transfer  |

## 🚀 How to Reproduce

1. Install [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)
2. Start capturing on your active network interface.
3. Generate traffic (browse a website, ping a server).
4. Stop the capture after ~1 minute.
5. Use filters like `http`, `dns`, and `tcp` to inspect packets.
6. Save the capture as `.pcap` and analyze.
